This directory contains a script for installing OpenCV, Eigen and Sophus
on a Ubuntu computer, i.e. getting the exact same setup as used on
the lab computers in the course UNIK 4690.

The only required action is to call the script 00-install-opencv.sh, which will
internally call the other scripts.

A handful of sudo-commands are issued, which is mainly 'sudo apt install' and
'sudo make install' commands.

Usage:
./00-install-opencv.sh
